#WIP

# BMax-Shader-Framework
Blitzmax shader framework

This is a module that should be placed into a 'BLITZMAX_INSTALL/mod/srs.mod/shaderframework.mod/' folder.

#Goals
The end goal of the module is to allow standard shader support for the standard GL, D3D9 and D3D11 graphics contexts while
using a single unified command set.

Examples of how to use it will be provided in the 'Examples' folder.

#NOTE
This is a work in progress to see where it ends up.
